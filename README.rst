Terminator
==========

Terminator is an online terminology management and discussion tool. It tries to
lower the barrier of entry, but also provides tools to enable teams to work
towards higher quality while welcoming newcomers.


Terminator is a Server
----------------------

Terminator is written in Python using the Django framework and therefore can be
installed on any web server that supports serving WSGI applications.

A number of terminology projects (glossaries) for a number of languages can be
hosted on Terminator. It allows a team to manage their terms, permissions,
projects, and also allows for online terminology searching. Terminator allows
a discussion for each term for every language. Files in ISO 30042 TermBase
eXchange (TBX) standard format can be downloaded for offline use in CAT tools
like Virtaal. Terminator also supports terminology importing for allowing a
team to continue a previous terminology work without starting from zero.
